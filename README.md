## Summary

This repository contains code from various courses and projects completed during my Minor Abroad focusing on Computational Engineering at ETH Zurich in the late 2015/early 2016. 

Some of the projects are collaborative and contain skeleton code provided by ETH Zurich or work by other students, which is included to avoid breaking the code. If I am not the author of a specific file or snippet, this has been indicated by comments in the code. However since I am unable to grant license for such work, please follow carefully the licensing information in each specific folder. MIT license placed in the folder applies to all files in this folder or subfolders (but not the project or repository). MIT license may also be added to a specific file if I am allowed to grant it. In all other cases, no license is granted.
