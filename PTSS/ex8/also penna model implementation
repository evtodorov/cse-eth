we want the bunch of fishes in a container (based on the benchmark)
we can use the stl algorithms on the container

step() //time passes
	fish grows older
	remove the dead ones
	create children
		select a pregnant fish
		generate a child from the pregnant fishes
		put them back in the population

algorithms: ransfrom, remove_if, remove_copy_if, for_each
 std::mem_fun_ref( ) : get some predicate for the ifs


ploto PopulationSize ( time );
plot  #ofFishesHavingTheBadGene(genome) (@ t=0 and @ t=end)
